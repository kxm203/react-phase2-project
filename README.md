# react-phase2-project
Kairi, TaKeya and Kenny are going to build from scratch a React app that involves a food menu. 
Our requirements are:
1. Build a single page application using create-react-app.
2. Use at least 5 components (App, Header, About, MenuBody, MenuItems, AddNewMenuItems) to keep the code well organized.
3. We will have at least 3 client-side routes using React Router (possibly the three will direct to About, MenuBody, and MenuItems).
4. Use a json-server to create a RESTfull API for the backend, and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. 
5. We will add styling through CSS by scratch, or by a UI framework.
