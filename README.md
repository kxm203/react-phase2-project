# react-phase2-project

Welcome To Foodie's Live Forever Landing Page! It's great to have you! 

This is our group's (Kairi W., TaKeya M. and Kenny M.) final project to demonstrate what we learned during Phase 2.

Our goal is to create a user friendly foodie menu for a client with the ability to add another foodie food to the list! Users would go to the website view the food options, and would go to the website to find out new foods added and can possibly add their own foodie likes/loves.

To accomplish that, we had a few tasks to set up. We split up and individually worked on the HTML, CSS and Javascript required to complete the project.

A few goals that our project accomplished are as follows:

1. Build a single page application using create-react-app. Added a server component into the package.json. If you would like to participate in the coding experience feel free to type into your Terminal " npm run server " . 

2. Use at least 5 components (App, Header, ErrorPage, Menu, New Menu Items, Navigation Bar, and Add New Menu Items) to keep the code well organized.

3. We will have at least 3 client-side routes using React Router ( directed to Main, Menu, and New Menu Items). All of the client - side routing are equally equipped with an error page to notify the User.

4. Use a json-server to create a RESTfull API for the backend, and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. 

5. We will add styling through CSS by scratch, for a fully encompassing UI.. The CSS needed to be constructed in a way that the project would not only be legible, but pleasing to read for users.

Thanks for participating, viewing, or simply adoring our Phase 2 project! I hope you have a fully encompassing idea of what we trying to acomplish. It was a challening project that required our full understanding of the concepts required. Yet, it was fun and enjoyable due to the collaboration efforts of the group members involved! 

LOVE LIVE THE FOODIE'S & PROSPER ! üçïü•óüçü
